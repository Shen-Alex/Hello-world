# Hello-world
This is Alex Shen. A fresh start today for me in Github. I am a statistician working in clinical trial. An interesting thing I wanted to do in Github is to create Shiny web dashboard for data review in clinical trial, or sample size calculator which can be used by our coleagues for instance physicians.
Ready to GO!
